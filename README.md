# BrotherHackathon-2022-micro-challenge-015

A new Flutter project.

The goal of this project is to scan a document with DS-940DW and run FireBaseML text extraction to identify text in the image.

The scanning behavior is based on [Demo-Air-Brother-Prime](https://github.com/CodeMinion/Demo-Air-Brother-Prime), which uses the library 
[air_brother](https://github.com/CodeMinion/air_brother) library.

The FireBase ML text extraction follows [this tutorial](https://blog.codemagic.io/text-recognition-using-firebase-ml-kit-flutter/). The tutorial's soure code is the 
[flutter_vision](https://github.com/sbis04/flutter_vision) repo.
